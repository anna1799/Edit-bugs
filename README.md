# Edit-bugs

I've tested an app to convert and optimize pictures and was responsible for an "Edit" module. This module has 7 functions: delete, rotate left, rotate right, flip horizontal, optimize, select as cover, order by random.

Here are bugs reported by me that are related to the "Edit" module.
